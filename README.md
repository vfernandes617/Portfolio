- [TwentyOne Game](https://github.com/vfernandes617/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)
- [Basic basketball shooting game](https://github.com/vfernandes617/The-Tech-Academy-Unity-Projects/tree/main/GAME%20SUBMISSION%20ASSIGNMENT) 
- [Solor System](https://github.com/vfernandes617/The-Tech-Academy-Unity-Projects/tree/main/mini_solar_sys/Assets)

## C# Basics learned in this course
I learned about CIL that onverts C# code into the assembly. I also learned Type safety refers to the degree to which a programming language prevents type errors 
Other examples include; <br>
1. [Loops](https://github.com/vfernandes617/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Loops)<br>
2. [Data Types](https://github.com/vfernandes617/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Array) <br>
3. [Math in C#](https://github.com/vfernandes617/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Coporation%20app)Math concepts and how to use basic operators, math casting <br>
4. [Comparison operators](https://github.com/vfernandes617/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Coporation%20app) using boolean basics <br>
5. [Branching](https://github.com/vfernandes617/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Branching%20assignment) <br>
6. [Methods](https://github.com/vfernandes617/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CallingMethods) <br>
7. [Classes](https://github.com/vfernandes617/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CLASS%20SUBMISSION%20ASSIGNMENT) <br>
